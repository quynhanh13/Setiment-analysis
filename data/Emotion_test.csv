This news really brightens my day
Can't believe I fall for that stupid lie he said 
I get into groups where I feel really awkward and overcompensate by being too talkative or by getting really quiet
I feel as if I should be punished for neglecting you
Love you and always support you!!!
I was shocked when hearing that he was gonna end his career
I finally get the job I want since I was a child. It's the first time I fell such happy
She brings so much positive energy. I can see joys in her eyes and happiness in her smile
I feel really proud of myself for accomplishing that
I couldn't hide my disappointment when I heard the outcome
I couldn't contain my joy when I received her message
I felt a wave of nostalgia wash over me as I walked through familiar streets.
That was such a stupid idea I can't believe I listened to you
I secretly delighted in their surprise visit. I had been waiting for them for so long.
I feel like I should be spending this precious last half hour doing something fun and interesting to roll into my new year and by not doing so I'm letting myself down
I feel violent and crazy and I feel myself slowly losing patience
This movie really got me. I burst into tears right after I got out of the cinema. Its story reminded me of the actual sadness I have carried for so long.
"I have come here 3 years ago and it's still one of the best cities I have ever vistied. You can feel the love, the joy all around you, the people are hospitable, the foods are delicious,… Nothing to complaint."
I can't believe my ears when hearing that you would come to my city. So supprise!!!! Can't wait to see you in the concert
This is type of news I want to see everyday. It would make everyone feel happy just like me right now.
